# Text Editor Challenge

This is a front-end application that allows users to create documents, read all documents, and edit each document.

## Front-end built with:

* React.js
* Semantic UI
* Custom CSS Styling

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Setup

```
# clone the github repo
git clone https://github.com/idaliaramos/TextEditor.git
# install dependencies
npm install
# starts the server
npm start
```

## Process

###### Git workflow

When working on this project I cut feature branches, and when I finished I merged it to master. I have pushed all of the branches to github if you would like to see more of my process.

###### UI Development and UX

When building this editor, making a clean and intuitive UI was one of my main goals. I wanted to keep it minimal, yet show information that could be useful to the user, such as who was the person who edited the document last, and all of the owners of the doc. In my process I tried a few different layouts, and found through some minimal user testing what users preferred and adjusted my ui for users satisfaction.

We dont have a user image/avatar yet, but I thought that could be a fun future implementation we could add in the future to personalize. I set an image icon for now.

###### Development Decisions

For this project I used React.js and Semantic UI, with some custom css. I was contemplating wether to use Semantic UI or just develop my own css components. I got the impression that it was important for my prospective team to know I have CSS skills, but there is also a time constraint on my part. I decided to use Semantic UI framework because its unnecessary to repeat work that has already been done before, and also made a custom component, added custom CSS and made the layout responsive to show my CSS skills.By combining these two methods I hope to show my skills using a framework, and also my own CSS skills to the team.
