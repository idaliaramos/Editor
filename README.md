# Text Editor Challenge

This is a front-end application that allows users to create, read and edit documents. You can checkout the live site here: [https://texteditor.surge.sh/](https://texteditor.surge.sh/)

## Front-end built with:

* React.js
* Semantic UI
* Custom CSS Styling

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Setup

```
# clone the github repo
git clone https://github.com/idaliaramos/Editor.git && cd Editor
# install dependencies
npm install
# starts the server
npm start
```

## Process

###### Git workflow

When working on this project I cut feature branches, and when I finished I merged it to master. I have pushed all of the branches to Github if you would like to see more of my process.

###### UI Development and UX

When building this editor, making a clean and intuitive UI was one of my main goals. I wanted to keep it minimal, yet show information that could be useful to the user, such as a document's most recent editor, and all of the owners of the document. In my process I tried a few different layouts, found through some user testing what users preferred, and adjusted my UI for user satisfaction.

We don't have a user image/avatar yet, but I thought that it could be a nice future feature to customize the experience. I set an image icon for now.

###### Development Decisions

For this project I used React.js and Semantic UI, with some custom CSS. I was contemplating whether to use Semantic UI or just develop my own CSS components. I got the impression that it was important for my prospective team to know I have CSS skills, but there is also a time constraint on my part. I hope this shows my ability to implement relevant frameworks and develop custom CSS as appropriate.
